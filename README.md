# Temazone

In this project I got to learn how a full stack project is made
and how Frontend and backend work together.

I tried using the latest industry standard 
Next-Auth for Authentication and Session management
NextJs 14 for frontend 
Server Actions for interacting with the backend
Prisma ORM for database Operations
