# Temazone

In this project I got to learn how a full stack project is made
and how Frontend and backend work together.

I tried using the latest industry standard <br/>
Next-Auth for Authentication and Session management <br/>
NextJs 14 for frontend <br/>
Server Actions for interacting with the backend <br/>
Prisma ORM for database Operations
